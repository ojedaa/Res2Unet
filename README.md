# Res2Unet
A new FCNN for biomedical image segmentation. We implemented an efficient architecture based on the Heun's method to improve the network perfomance withoud needing of more layers.

Res2Unet is based on the U-Net [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_28] and ResUnet [doi: 10.1109/LGRS.2018.2802944] original architectures. 

With this architecture we improved the perfomance of T. cruzi parasite segmentation in compare with the U-Net and ResUnet models. We obtain the best performance using the Active Contour Loss Function [doi: https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2019.01190] and the residual functions presented on [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46493-0_38].
